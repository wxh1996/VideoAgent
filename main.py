    However, the information in the initial frames is not suffient.
    Objective:
    Our goal is to identify additional frames that contain crucial information necessary for answering the question. These frames should not only address the query directly but should also complement the insights gleaned from the descriptions of the initial frames.
    To achieve this, we will:
    1. Divide the video into segments based on the intervals between the initial frames as, candiate segments: {segment_des}
    2. Determine which segments are likely to contain frames that are most relevant to the question. These frames should capture key visual elements, such as objects, humans, interactions, actions, and scenes, that are supportive to answer the question.
    For each frame identified as potentially relevant, provide a concise description focusing on essential visual elements. Use a single sentence per frame. If the specifics of a segment's visual content are uncertain based on the current information, use placeholders for specific actions or objects, but ensure the description still conveys the segment's relevance to the query.
    Select multiple frames from one segment if necessary to gather comprehensive insights. 
    Return the descriptions and the segment id in JSON format, note "segment_id" must be smaller than {len(segment_des) + 1}, "duration" should be the same as candiate segments:
